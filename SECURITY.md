# 🔐 Security Policy — Elmahrosa International / TEOS

## Purpose

This document defines the **security, vulnerability disclosure, and incident handling policy**
for all repositories governed under **Elmahrosa International** and the **TEOS Sovereign Framework**.

Security is treated as a **civic obligation**, not a best-effort practice.

| Reference Implementations | Actively Supported |

## Disclosure Process

1. **Acknowledgement** within 72 hours  
2. **Assessment & classification** (severity, scope)
3. **Mitigation or patch** under constitutional constraints
4. **Coordinated disclosure** if required

## Governance & Authority

All security decisions are bound by:

- International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)

> No security fix may violate constitutional authority or lawful governance.
