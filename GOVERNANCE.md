# ⚖️ Governance — Elmahrosa International / TEOS

## Governance Model

Elmahrosa International operates under a **constitution-first governance model**.

Authority flows strictly **top-down**:

```

International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)
↓
TEOS Governance Logic
↓
Execution Systems

```

No repository, maintainer, or automation may override constitutional authority.

---

## Root of Trust

The **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)** is the sole Root of Trust.

All governance logic, policies, and execution rules derive their legitimacy from it.

---

## Decision Authority

| Level | Authority |
|---|---|
| Constitutional | ICBC |
| Governance Logic | TEOS-Governance |
| Execution | Elmahrosa-Core & Sovereign Systems |

Automation **executes** authority — it never creates it.

---

## Changes & Amendments

- Constitutional changes follow ICBC-defined procedures
- Governance logic changes must remain compliant
- Execution changes are invalid if governance is breached

---

## Forking & Derivatives

Forking constitutional or governance repositories **does not confer legitimacy**.

Only repositories maintained under Elmahrosa International
retain sovereign validity.

---

## Final Principle

> **Law governs code.  
> Authority governs execution.  
> Governance governs change.**
