## 🌍 Strategic Mission
**Elmahrosa International** is the architect of **TEOS**, a constitution-first framework for **Sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**. Originated in Egypt and engineered for global scalability, TEOS provides the digital bedrock for modern nation-states, ensuring that technology serves the law, never the other way around.

TEOS is designed for **Ministries, Central Banks, and International Financial Institutions (IFIs)** who require the efficiency of Web3 with the safety of traditional institutional oversight.

---

## 🛡️ The TEOS Doctrine
* **Law-Centric Code:** Every system action is subordinate to the Supreme Constitution (ICBC).
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** AI and automation provide signals; human institutions provide authority.
* **Justice-Grade Auditability:** Every execution is recorded as tamper-evident forensic evidence.
* **Zero-Speculation:** TEOS is a utility-only ecosystem designed for civic and institutional use.

## 🪙 TEOS Token (Civic Eligibility Signal)
The TEOS token is a **non-tradable, non-speculative civic utility**.
* **Purpose:** Exclusively for participation in the 2026 Constitutional Pilot.
* **Status:** Intentionally non-commercial; carries no financial or equity value.
* **Function:** Cryptographic signaling of eligibility within the sovereign stack.

## 🧪 2026 National Pilot Architecture
TEOS is currently in an active institutional pilot phase, validating the deployment of **National Identity Registries** and **Sovereign Data Exchange** models in a sandboxed Cairo environment. This work aligns with **GovStack v1.0** and **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)**.
