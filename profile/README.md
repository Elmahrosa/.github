## 🌍 What Is Elmahrosa?

**Elmahrosa International** is a **Sovereign Software Factory** that designs and deploys **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** for nations. 

At its core is **TEOS (The Elmahrosa Operating System)** — a foundational civic blockchain layer enabling governments to digitize society **without surrendering sovereignty**.

> **"Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World."**

## 🧭 The DPI Hourglass (World Bank Model)

Elmahrosa implements the **DPI Hourglass Architecture**, ensuring a "Narrow Waist" of core standards that support infinite innovation.

| Layer | Component | Elmahrosa Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Top (Apps)** | E-Services | `Pi-Smart-City`, `TeosPitaxi`, `Salma-Hospital` |
| **Waist (Core)** | **DPI Standards** | **Identity (eID), Payments (BankChain), Data (Nilex)** |
| **Base (Tech)** | Infrastructure | `elmahrosa-core`, Sovereign Mesh, Multi-Chain (SOL/ETH/BTC) |

## 🧠 The Sovereign Mesh (51-Repo Core)

Our organization is orchestrated as a **Unified Sovereign Mesh**. Every repository is linked to the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution**, ensuring that technical execution is always bound by civic law.

* **Recursive Governance:** 51+ repositories synchronized via Git Submodules.  
* **Audit-Ready DNA:** Standardized `/audit` manifests in every project for regulator transparency.  
* **Constitutional Integrity:** Logic validated against our global [Civic Ledger](https://github.com/Elmahrosa/International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution).  

---

## 🧱 GovStack Building Blocks

Elmahrosa repositories are modularized according to **GovStack (ITU/World Bank)** specifications:

* 🆔 **Identity:** W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for secure e-government.  
* 💳 **Payments:** Regulated, multi-chain financial rails via `BankChain` and `FundsChain`.  
* 📊 **Registries:** Sovereign data vaults for land, healthcare, and civic records.  
* 🔗 **Information Mediator:** Secure cross-departmental data exchange (Nilex Engine).

## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

Install the TEOS Forge CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @teos/forge-cli
```

Initialize a new sovereign project:

```bash
teos init my-dpi-project --template identity-registry
```

Validate governance compliance:

```bash
teos validate
```

Deploy to testnet:

```bash
teos deploy --testnet
```

Export an audit bundle:

```bash
teos audit --export pdf
```

> Every project begins governed. No code runs outside constitutional boundaries.
